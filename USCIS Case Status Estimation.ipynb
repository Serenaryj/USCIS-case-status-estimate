    "My goal of this project was to predict when I would receive my EAD card from USCIS, but I received it sooner than I thought so the data collecting was not complete to have a solid project. However, the script I wrote could be useful to many people to get a better idea when their case will be processed. I will continue to work on the visulization and forecast in the future when my green card application is sent out. "
